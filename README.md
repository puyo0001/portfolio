# María José Puyol's MTM6201 Portfolio

## Project Description

Welcome to my Web Portafolio for the Web Development II class on Algonquin College.

## Challenges

My main challenge was incorporating Bootstrap, modifying the colours without relying heavily on CSS, and optimizing many images in the portfolio.

## Lessons Learned

- I learnt how to use Bootstrap to make grids, and it facilitated the overall responsivness of the site, also I had to do a lot trouble shooting to make everything looks as I wanted.

- Incorporating Animate.css to animate my logo in a quick efective way.
